Question 1.


```{r}
#Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(CodeClanData)
#Check data
head(backpack)
```

Question 2.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = "orange"), col = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Backpack Weight",
    y = "Count"
  )
```


Question 3.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex), col = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ sex)
```


Question 4.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_line(aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight))
```
There is no relationship - can be seen from this line graph which shows no trend and consistently peaks and troughs

Question 5.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_line(aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight)) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex)
```


Question 6.

```{r}

ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = back_problems, yposition = "fill"))
```
