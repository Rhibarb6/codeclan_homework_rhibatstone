## What is it? 

An algorithm that groups together similar objects creating clusters starting with each observation as it's own group or ***cluster***. It repeats two steps:    

1. Identifies two closest clusters    
2. Merges those two clusters  
Until all clusters are merged into one. 

*For example*:

The output of this clustering is a **dendrogram** which represents the *hierachical* relationship between the clusters.

## Strengths

- Easy to understand
- Easy to do

## Weaknesses

- Rarely provides the best solution
- Dendrograms are commonly misinterpreted

- Lack of theoretical basis for decisions
  - Specifiying distance metric
  - Specifiying linkage
- Doesn't work well with 
  - Large data
  - Mixed data types
    - E.g 
  - Missing data
