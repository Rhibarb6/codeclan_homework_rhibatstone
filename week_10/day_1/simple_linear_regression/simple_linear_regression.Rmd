```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)

project <- read_csv("project_management.csv")
glimpse(project)
```

```{r}
plot(project$estimated_length, project$actual_length) + 
  text(project$estimated_length, project$actual_length, labels = seq(nrow(project)), cex = 0.7, pos = 2)

```
5 is likley an influential outlier, whereas 18 is likely a non-influential outlier

```{r}
model <- lm(estimated_length ~ actual_length, data = project)
model

autoplot(model, which = 4)
```
I would say that this plot confirms my identification of 5 being an influenctial outlier

```{r}

plot(project$estimated_length, project$actual_length)
```
