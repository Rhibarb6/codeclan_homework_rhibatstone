1. 

  - Likely overfitting because all the children with have a similar DOB as they are all 6yr
  olds. Additionally, 

2. 

  - AIC score of 33,559 as the lower AIC score is better

3. 

  - Should use the first as it has a higher adjusted r-squared despite having a lower
  r-squared. Meaning that the additional variables in the second model do not enhance the
  model.

4. 

  - No because the errors are small and similar?
  
5. 

  - You split the data into n folds, then make a model with the data n times using a
  different fold as the test set and the rest as the training set each time. 

6. 

  - This is an additional subset of data that is not used in test or training and is only
  used once a final model has been chosen in order to avoid overfitting the data.

7. 

  - Start with a model that contains all the predictors, then remove the predictor that
  reduces the r-squared value the least. Repeat, noting the order of removed variables,
  until all variables removed. 

8. 

  - It tests models using every possible combination of predictors for each model size
  (number of predictors used) to find the best r-squared value for each size.
  

9. 
  
  - Simplicity (Occams Razor)
  - Doesn't take a long time to run
  - Do the chosen variables make sense to be there
    - Are they appropriate
  - Ability to identify the most explanatory variables
  - Will it continue to work on new data
  - Is is standardised (will it work in all situations)
  - Sufficient documentation

10. 

  - 

11. 

  - Population Stability Index (PSI) compares the distribution of a scoring variable
  (predicted probability) in scoring data set to a training data set that was used to
  develop the model. The idea is to check â€œHow the current scoring is compared to the
  predicted probability from training data set

12. 
 
  - 

13. 

  - Overfitting
  - Not being valid on a new sample

14. 

  -

15. 

 - So they can be compared and also to help understand what each model is doing

16. 

  - So that any ddecisions have clear justification and others can use and implement the
  model without your supervision.
